# Singly Linked List
Implement a singly linked list data structure

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.

Define methods listed in API 

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API
**Insert method**
	Input <- any value as an argument
	Output <- adds a new node with that value to the head of linked list

**Includes method**
	Input <- any value as an argument 
	Output <- boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list

**Print method**
	Input <- no arguments 
	Output <- a collection of all the current Node values in the linked list
